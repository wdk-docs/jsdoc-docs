Syntax
------

``@member [<type>] [<name>]``

Overview
--------

The @member tag identifies any member that does not have a more
specialized kind, such as “class”, “function”, or “constant”. A member
can optionally have a type as well as a name.

Examples
--------

{% example “Using @member with Data#point” %}

.. code:: js

   /** @class */
   function Data() {
       /** @member {Object} */
       this.point = {};
   }

{% endexample %}

Here is an example of using @var, a synonym of @member, to document a
(virtual) variable ‘foo’.

{% example “Using @var to document a virtual member” %}

.. code:: js

   /**
    * A variable in the global namespace called 'foo'.
    * @var {number} foo
    */

{% endexample %}

The above example is equivalent to the following:

.. code:: js

   /**
    * A variable in the global namespace called 'foo'.
    * @type {number}
    */
   var foo;
